{"word": "cat", "definition": "From Middle English cat, catte, from Old English catt ('male cat'), catte ('female cat'), from Proto-West Germanic *kattu, from Proto-Germanic *kattuz, generally thought to be from Late Latin cattus ('domestic cat') (c. 350, Palladius), from Latin catta (c. 75 A.D., Martial), from an Afroasiatic language. This would roughly match how domestic cats themselves spread, as genetic studies suggest they began to spread out of the Near East / Fertile Crescent during the Neolithic (being in Cyprus by 9500 years ago, and Greece and Italy by 2500 years ago), especially after they became popular in Egypt. However, every proposed source word has presented problems. Adolphe Pictet and many subsequent sources refer to Barabra (Nubian) [script needed] (kaddîska) and 'Nouba' (Nobiin) ????¯? (kadis, 'kadis') as possible sources or cognates, but M. Lionel Bender says the Nubian word is a loan from Arabic ?????? (qi??a). Jean-Paul Savignac suggests the Latin word is from an Egyptian precursor of Coptic ??? (sau, 'tomcat') suffixed with feminine -t, but John Huehnergard says 'the source . was clearly not Egyptian itself, where no analogous form is attested.' It may be a wanderword. Kroonen says the word must have existed in Germanic from a very early date, as it shows morphological alternations, and suggests that it might have been borrowed from Uralic, compare Northern Sami gadfe ('female stoat') and Hungarian hölgy ('stoat; lady, bride') from Proto-Uralic *kädwä ('female (of a fur animal)').

{"word": "dog", "definition": "Inherited from Middle English dogge (akin to Scots dug), from Old English dogga, docga, of uncertain origin.\nThe original meaning seems to have been a common dog, as opposed to a well-bred one, or something like 'cur', and perhaps later came to be used for stocky dogs. Possibly a pet-form diminutive with suffix -ga (compare frocga (“frog”), *picga (“pig”)), appended to a base *dog-, *doc- of unclear origin and meaning. One possibility is Old English dox (“dark, swarthy”) (compare frocga from frox). Another proposal is that it derives from Proto-West Germanic *dugan (“to be suitable”), the origin of Old English dugan (“to be good, worthy, useful”), English dow, Dutch deugen, German taugen. The theory goes that it could have been an epithet for dogs, commonly used by children, meaning \"good/useful animal\". Another is that it is related to *docce (“stock, muscle”), from Proto-West Germanic *dokkā (“round mass, ball, muscle, doll”), whence English dock (“stumpy tail”).\nIn 14th-century England, hound (from Old English hund) was the general word for all domestic canines, and dog referred to a subtype resembling the modern mastiff and bulldog. By the 16th century, dog had become the general word, and hound had begun to refer only to breeds used for hunting. In the 16th century, the word dog was adopted by several continental European languages as their word for mastiff.\nDespite similarities in forms and meaning, not related to Mbabaram dog.", "output": " Middle English doge < Old English dogga, docga < Uncertain origin"}
